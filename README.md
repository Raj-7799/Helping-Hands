# Helping-Hands-SIH2018
Helping Hand is an Online and Offline Disaster Management System for Govt. of Assam with motive to help government and people of Assam during disaster. This project is a part of a solution developed for Smart India Hackathon 2018 that received 1st runner up prize

## Summary
Assam residents face critical problems due to sudden and unexpected occurrence of disaster which leads to loss of life and property. This problem is faced every year, so our solution acts as an effective tool providing right information and services at the right time to the person in need at the critical time of disaster. We present an approach which comes effective for giving forecasting of expected disaster in advance, helps in evacuating masses to safe locations providing safe routes and also providing a common platform for volunteers to reach out to the affected people, for government to monitor the entire state, organizing people in shelter and their basic needs. Using interactive videos and simple step by step advice through SMS and push notification we empower user on how to react in such situations. During disaster the main issue is internet connectivity so we have also provided these entire features mentioned above in offline mode as well.
